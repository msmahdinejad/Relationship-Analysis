# Relationship Analysis

## Project Overview

**Relationship Analysis** is a powerful tool designed to visualize and process various entities and data as nodes and edges in graphs. This application aids data analysts in understanding the connections and relationships between disparate pieces of information. Leveraging the **EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value)** model for dynamic data structuring, the project emphasizes clean coding practices and modularity. Built using the **ASP.NET Core** framework, the tool simplifies complex investigations such as banking fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering cases by offering intuitive graph-based visualizations.

## Project Introduction

Imagine investigating a case of banking fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, or any other financial misconduct. Without a proper visualization tool, you would have to spend an enormous amount of time manually sifting through multiple databases to piece together the required data. Even after obtaining the information, additional effort is needed to connect the dots and understand relationships between various entities.

Visualization is one of the most effective ways to analyze data. By representing entities and their relationships in the form of a graph, we can reveal connections that are otherwise hidden. In this project, we aim to develop a tool that allows data analysts to visualize, explore, and analyze relationships using graphs, thus facilitating the investigation of various relationship-driven problems.

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication
- Users create accounts and authenticate using **JWT tokens** and **cookies** for secure access. This ensures that each userâ€™s access level is controlled and permissions are enforced throughout the system.

### 2. Dynamic Data Structure
- The project models everything in the system as one of the following:
  - **Graph Nodes (Vertices)**
  - **Graph Edges (Relationships)**
  - **Attributes** of either nodes or edges
  
- The **EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value)** approach in the database enables the system to dynamically work with various data types, allowing for future scalability and ease of adapting new types of data to the graph.

  Below is a sample of our database structure, designed to accommodate the dynamic nature of the data:

### 3. Search Functionality
- Thanks to the dynamic graph system, users can perform complex searches across both the attributes of graph nodes and edges. This functionality allows for powerful filtering and data retrieval based on user-defined criteria.

### 4. Node Expansion
- Users can explore the full scope of relationships by expanding from a selected node to reveal all its connected nodes.

### 5. Sanitizer Middleware
- To enhance security and data integrity, sanitizer middleware was integrated to ensure all input data is properly sanitized before processing. This prevents injection attacks and ensures that the data conforms to expected formats.
